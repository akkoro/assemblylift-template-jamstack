AssemblyLift Jamstack Template
------------------------------

The repository provides a template for bootstrapping an AssemblyLift [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org) application.

AssemblyLift **v0.3.1** or greater is required.

The web portion is a simple webpack site to demonstrate how a frontend can be integrated with an AssemblyLift project.
This could be replaced by full-featured framework such as React if desired.

### Building
First run `npm install`

The AssemblyLift services can be built as usual with `asml cast`.  
The web frontend is built by running `npm run build`.
